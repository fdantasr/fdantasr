### Hi, I'm Felipe Dantas ðŸ‘‹

Self-taught developer & UI Designer, computer science student from Brazil, committed to innovating great solutions to current problems. I specialize in digital design and development, but any activity that requires problem solving and creative thinking is where you'll find me.

Currently studying computer science and working as a software engineer and founder of startup <a href="https://www.dormiu.co">www.dormiu.co</a> and member/scholarship holder of the research group in Computational Numerical Modeling and Simulation at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT).

When I have some free time, I usually do some freelance work.
